Step-by-Step XTU Process:
1. Manual XTU Configuration (Recommended):
Open Intel XTU GUI and adjust:
Basic Tab:

Core Voltage Offset: -50mV (slight undervolt for efficiency)
Cache Voltage Offset: -30mV (improves stability)

Advanced Tab:

Power Limit 1: 125W (sustained boost)
Power Limit 2: 125W (peak boost)
Turbo Boost Power Max: 125W

Memory Tab (if available):

Enable XMP Profile if detected
Set to highest stable frequency (3200MHz+)

2. Use the Script Above for Automation
The script applies conservative settings that work for most i5-14400 systems.
3. Testing Protocol:
batch# After XTU changes:
1. Start mining with your optimized XMRig
2. Monitor for 30+ minutes
3. Check temperatures stay under 80°C
4. Verify system stability (no crashes)
5. Measure hashrate improvement
4. Expected Results:
Before XTU optimization:

Hashrate: 4,200-4,500 H/s
Temps: 75-85°C
Power: 65-80W

After XTU optimization:

Hashrate: 4,500-4,800 H/s (+200-400 H/s)
Temps: 70-80°C (better efficiency)
Power: 60-75W (lower due to undervolt)

5. If System Becomes Unstable:
batch# Reset XTU to defaults:
1. Open Intel XTU
2. Click "Reset to Default"
3. Apply less aggressive settings
4. Reduce voltage offsets to -25mV
6. Create XTU Profile for Your Farm:

Configure one system perfectly
In XTU: File → Export Profile → Save as mining_profile.xtu
Copy this profile to other systems
Import with: File → Import Profile
