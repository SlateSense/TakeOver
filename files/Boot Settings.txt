üõ°Ô∏è Secure Boot Status
Purpose: Ensures only trusted OS loaders and drivers are executed during boot.

Location in BIOS:

Usually under Security, Boot, or Authentication tab.

How to Configure:

Enter BIOS (press F2, Del, or Esc during boot).

Navigate to Security or Boot Options.

Find Secure Boot and set it to:

Enabled for protection.

Disabled if you're using unsigned bootloaders (e.g., custom Linux distros or stealth setups).

Press F10 to save and exit.

Windows Check:

Run msinfo32 ‚Üí check Secure Boot State under System Summary2.

üå¨Ô∏è Fan Control Options
Purpose: Manage cooling performance and noise levels.

Location in BIOS:

Usually under Hardware Monitor, Power, or Advanced tab.

How to Configure:

Enter BIOS and go to Hardware Monitor.

Enable Smart Fan Mode.

Set fan curves manually:

Low RPM at idle (e.g., 400‚Äì600 RPM at <40¬∞C).

Gradual ramp-up to max RPM at high temps (>80¬∞C).

Choose control mode:

PWM for 4-pin fans.

DC for 3-pin fans.

Save with F10.

Tip: Use BIOS fan curve editor or third-party tools like Fan Control, SpeedFan, or HWMonitor for finer control57.

‚öôÔ∏è CPU Features: C-States & SpeedStep
Purpose: Power-saving and dynamic frequency scaling.

Location in BIOS:

Under Advanced, CPU Configuration, or Power Management.

How to Configure:

Intel SpeedStep (EIST):

Enabled: Allows dynamic clock scaling.

Disabled: Locks CPU at max frequency (useful for mining or benchmarking).

C-States:

Enabled: Saves power by putting cores to sleep.

Disabled: Keeps cores active for latency-sensitive tasks.

Recommended for mining/performance:

Disable SpeedStep and C-States for consistent high performance911.

üß† RAM Speed and Timings
Purpose: Optimize memory bandwidth and latency.

Location in BIOS:

Under Ai Tweaker, Extreme Tweaker, or Advanced Memory Settings.

How to Configure:

Enable XMP (Intel) or DOCP/EXPO (AMD).

Select profile matching your RAM specs (e.g., 3200MHz CL16).

For manual tuning:

Set DRAM Frequency manually.

Adjust CAS Latency (CL), tRCD, tRP, tRAS.

Set DRAM Voltage (e.g., 1.35V for most DDR4 kits).

Save and reboot.

Tools for validation:

Use CPU-Z, Thaiphoon Burner, or AIDA64 to verify timings and stability1416.

üöÄ Boot Order & UEFI Settings
Purpose: Control boot device priority and OS compatibility.

Location in BIOS:

Under Boot, Advanced, or System Configuration.

How to Configure:

Go to Boot Options.

Set Boot Option #1 to your preferred device (e.g., SSD, USB).
