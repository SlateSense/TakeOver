═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CRITICAL SETTINGS (Most Important - 15-20% Hashrate Gain):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. ✅ ENABLE XMP/DOCP PROFILE FOR RAM
   Location: Advanced → Memory Settings → XMP
   Set to: Profile 1 or Profile 2 (whichever is highest)
   Impact: +10-15% hashrate
   Notes: Enables full RAM speed (3200MHz+ instead of 2400MHz)
   
   HOW TO CHECK: In Windows, open Task Manager → Performance → Memory
   - Should show 3200 MHz or higher (not 2400 MHz)

2. ✅ DISABLE ALL C-STATES
   Location: Advanced → CPU Configuration → CPU Power Management
   Settings to DISABLE:
   - C1E Support: DISABLED
   - C3 State: DISABLED
   - C6/C7 State: DISABLED
   - C8 State: DISABLED
   - Package C-State: DISABLED
   - CFG Lock: DISABLED (if present)
   
   Impact: +5-10% hashrate
   Why: Prevents CPU from sleeping/downclocking
   
3. ✅ DISABLE INTEL SPEEDSTEP / EIST
   Location: Advanced → CPU Configuration
   Set to: DISABLED
   Impact: CPU runs at full speed 24/7, no throttling

4. ✅ SET POWER LIMITS TO MAXIMUM
   Location: Advanced → CPU Configuration → Power Management
   Settings:
   - PL1 (Power Limit 1): 250W (or Maximum)
   - PL2 (Power Limit 2): 250W (or Maximum)  
   - Tau (Time Window): 4096 seconds
   - Current Limit: Maximum
   - Short Duration Power Limit: Disabled
   - Long Duration Power Limit: Disabled
   
   Impact: No throttling under sustained load
   Notes: i5-14400 typically uses 150-180W for mining
   
5. ✅ ENABLE ALL CPU CORES
   Location: Advanced → CPU Configuration
   Settings:
   - Active Processor Cores: All (10 cores)
   - Active E-Cores: All (4 E-cores)
   - Hyper-Threading: Enabled
   
   Impact: Use all 10 cores + 20 threads


SECONDARY SETTINGS (Additional 5-10% Gain):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

6. ✅ DISABLE TURBO BOOST POWER LIMITS
   Location: Advanced → CPU Configuration → Turbo Settings
   Settings:
   - Turbo Mode: ENABLED
   - Turbo Boost Power Limit: DISABLED or MAX
   - IA AC Load Line: 0.01 (lowest drooping)
   - IA DC Load Line: 0.01
   
   Impact: Sustained turbo frequencies without throttling

7. ⚠️ MEMORY TIMINGS (Advanced Users Only)
   Location: Advanced → Memory Settings → Manual Timings
   If comfortable:
   - Reduce tCL from 16 → 14 or 15
   - Reduce tRCD, tRP by 1-2
   - May need slight voltage increase (1.35V safe)
   
   Impact: +2-5% hashrate
   WARNING: Test for stability! Unstable = crashes

8. ✅ DISABLE UNNECESSARY DEVICES
   Location: Advanced → Integrated Peripherals
   Disable if not needed:
   - Onboard Audio: DISABLED (if using external or none)
   - WiFi/Bluetooth: DISABLED (if using Ethernet)
   - Serial/Parallel Ports: DISABLED
   
   Impact: Reduce system overhead

9. ✅ VIRTUALIZATION SETTINGS
   Location: Advanced → CPU Configuration
   Settings:
   - Intel VT-d: DISABLED (unless using VMs)
   - Intel VT-x: Can leave ENABLED
   
   Impact: Minor reduction in overhead

10. ✅ HPET (High Precision Event Timer)
    Location: Advanced → Chipset Configuration
    Set to: DISABLED
    Impact: Reduced timer overhead
    Note: Windows optimization script also disables this


COOLING & STABILITY (Essential):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

11. ⚠️ FAN CURVES (CRITICAL)
    Location: Hardware Monitor → Smart Fan Control
    Settings:
    - CPU Fan: Aggressive curve
      → 50% at 50°C
      → 75% at 65°C
      → 100% at 75°C
    - Chassis Fans: Keep at medium-high
    
    Target Temperature: Keep CPU under 85°C during mining
    WARNING: High temps = thermal throttling = lower hashrate

12. ✅ LLC (Load Line Calibration)
    Location: Advanced → Voltage Configuration
    Set to: Level 3-4 (Medium)
    Impact: Prevents voltage droop under heavy load
    Stability: Better sustained performance


OPTIONAL ADVANCED (For Experts):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

13. ⚠️ CPU UNDERVOLT (Thermal/Efficiency)
    Location: Advanced → Voltage Configuration
    Settings:
    - CPU Core Voltage Offset: -0.050V to -0.100V
    
    Benefits:
    - Lower temperatures (5-15°C drop)
    - Same or better hashrate
    - Less power consumption
    
    WARNING: Test extensively! May cause crashes if too aggressive
    Start with -0.050V, test for 24 hours, then try -0.075V

14. ✅ RING/CACHE RATIO
    Location: Advanced → CPU Configuration
    Settings:
    - Cache Ratio: 40-42 (4.0-4.2 GHz)
    - Ring Max OC Ratio: 42
    
    Impact: +2-3% hashrate for RandomX (cache-heavy)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Problem: System won't boot after changes
Solution: Clear CMOS
- Turn off PC
- Remove CMOS battery for 30 seconds
- Or use CMOS jumper on motherboard
- Settings will reset to defaults

Problem: System is unstable/crashes
Solution:
1. Re-enter BIOS
2. Reduce power limits (PL1/PL2 to 180W)
3. Or enable C-States back
4. Or increase voltages slightly

Problem: Overheating (>90°C)
Solution:
1. Check CPU cooler mounting
2. Replace thermal paste
3. Increase fan speeds
4. Improve case airflow
5. Consider better CPU cooler

Problem: Low hashrate despite optimizations
Solution:
1. Verify XMP is actually enabled (check Task Manager → RAM speed)
2. Check Windows Task Manager - is RAM at 3200+ MHz?
3. Ensure miner is using all CPU threads
4. Check CPU frequency - should be at boost clocks
5. Monitor throttling with HWiNFO64

Problem: XMP won't enable / RAM unstable
Solution:
1. Try Profile 2 instead of Profile 1
2. Manually set RAM speed (e.g., 3200 MHz)
3. Increase RAM voltage slightly (1.35V)
4. Update BIOS to latest version
