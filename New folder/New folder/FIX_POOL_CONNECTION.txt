 FIX: "read error: end of file" - Pool Connection Issue
================================================================

THE PROBLEM:
============
From your screenshot, the miner is running but can't connect:

"net gulf.moneroocean.stream:10128 read error: end of file"

This means:
✓ Miner binary works
✓ Config loads correctly  
✓ Miner starts successfully
✗ Pool server closes connection immediately

================================================================
 POSSIBLE CAUSES & SOLUTIONS:
================================================================

CAUSE 1: FIREWALL BLOCKING OUTBOUND CONNECTIONS ⭐ MOST LIKELY
--------------------------------------------------------------
Windows Firewall or your router might be blocking the miner's
outbound connection to the pool.

SOLUTION A: Add Firewall Exception
-----------------------------------
1. Windows Defender Firewall → Advanced settings
2. Outbound Rules → New Rule
3. Program → Browse to xmrig.exe
4. Allow the connection
5. Apply to all profiles (Domain, Private, Public)
6. Name it "XMRig Mining"

SOLUTION B: Temporarily Disable Firewall (Testing Only)
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Windows Defender Firewall → Turn off
2. Test if miner connects
3. If it works → Add proper firewall rule
4. Re-enable firewall

SOLUTION C: Command Line (Quick)
---------------------------------
Run this as admin:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="XMRig" dir=out action=allow program="%CD%\xmrig.exe" enable=yes


CAUSE 2: ISP/NETWORK BLOCKING CRYPTO MINING
--------------------------------------------
Some ISPs or school/college networks block crypto mining.

SOLUTION: Use Different Port or VPN
------------------------------------
Try these alternative ports:
- Port 20128 (non-TLS): gulf.moneroocean.stream:20128
- Port 3333 (SupportXMR): pool.supportxmr.com:3333
- Use a VPN to bypass network restrictions


CAUSE 3: TLS NOT PROPERLY CONFIGURED
-------------------------------------
Port 10128 REQUIRES TLS encryption.
If TLS is false or missing in config, connection fails.

SOLUTION: Verify TLS in Config
-------------------------------
Run: CHECK_CONFIG.bat
Look for: "tls": true in the pools section

If missing or false, the config needs to be fixed.


CAUSE 4: ANTIVIRUS BLOCKING NETWORK ACCESS
-------------------------------------------
Some antivirus software blocks network access for miners.

SOLUTION: Check Antivirus Settings
-----------------------------------
1. Check your antivirus logs
2. Add network exception for xmrig.exe
3. Temporarily disable antivirus to test
4. If it works, add proper exceptions

================================================================
 QUICK TEST PROCEDURE:
================================================================

STEP 1: Test Pool Connection
-----------------------------
Run: TEST_POOL_CONNECTION.bat

This creates a minimal config and tests if you can connect.

IF SUCCESSFUL (you see "new job"):
  → The miner can connect to pools
  → The problem is in the deployment config
  → Solution: Fix the deployment config

IF FAILS (still "read error: end of file"):
  → Network/firewall issue
  → Continue to Step 2


STEP 2: Test Without TLS (Different Port)
------------------------------------------
Edit test config to use port 20128 (non-TLS):
"url": "gulf.moneroocean.stream:20128"
"tls": false

Run miner again.

IF SUCCESSFUL:
  → Firewall allows non-TLS but blocks TLS
  → Solution: Use non-TLS port or fix firewall

IF FAILS:
  → Complete network blockage
  → Continue to Step 3


STEP 3: Add Firewall Exception
-------------------------------
Run as admin:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="XMRig Out" dir=out action=allow program="%CD%\xmrig.exe" enable=yes
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="XMRig In" dir=in action=allow program="%CD%\xmrig.exe" enable=yes

Test again.

IF SUCCESSFUL:
  → Firewall was blocking it
  → Solution: Keep firewall rules

IF FAILS:
  → ISP/network level blocking
  → Continue to Step 4


STEP 4: Test on Mobile Hotspot
-------------------------------
1. Create mobile hotspot from your phone
2. Connect PC to phone's hotspot
3. Test miner again

IF SUCCESSFUL:
  → Your home network/ISP is blocking mining
  → Solution: Use VPN or different network

IF FAILS:
  → Something else is wrong
  → Check antivirus/security software

================================================================
 FOR COMPETITION:
================================================================

If your home network blocks mining but mobile hotspot works:
→ College network likely blocks it too!

SOLUTIONS FOR COMPETITION:
1. Use non-TLS port (20128) - less likely to be detected
2. Use SOCKS5 proxy to obfuscate traffic
3. Use different pool that's not commonly blocked
4. Check if college allows mining (some do for research)

TEST BEFORE COMPETITION:
------------------------
1. Test on your network
2. Test on mobile hotspot
3. Test on a public WiFi
4. If all work → competition will likely work
5. If all fail → need to investigate further

================================================================
 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR WHEN WORKING:
================================================================

When miner successfully connects, you'll see:

[2025-10-31 18:40:00] net  gulf.moneroocean.stream:10128
[2025-10-31 18:40:01] [green] new job from gulf.moneroocean.stream:10128
[2025-10-31 18:40:05] speed 10s/60s/15m 1234.5 n/a n/a H/s
[2025-10-31 18:40:10] [green] accepted (1/0) diff 5000
[2025-10-31 18:40:15] speed 10s/60s/15m 1250.3 1245.7 n/a H/s

Key indicators:
✓ "new job" in green = Connected to pool
✓ "speed" = Mining is working
✓ "accepted" in green = Shares accepted, earning money

================================================================
 IMMEDIATE ACTION:
================================================================

Run these 3 commands AS ADMIN:

1. Add firewall exception:
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="XMRig-Out" dir=out action=allow program="%CD%\xmrig.exe" enable=yes

2. Test pool connection:
   RUN: TEST_POOL_CONNECTION.bat

3. Watch the output:
   - If you see "new job" → SUCCESS!
   - If you see "read error" → Network/firewall blocking

================================================================
 SUMMARY:
================================================================

Error: "read error: end of file"
→ Miner works, but can't connect to pool
→ Most likely: Firewall blocking outbound connection

SOLUTION:
1. Add firewall exception (netsh command above)
2. Run TEST_POOL_CONNECTION.bat
3. If works → Update deployment config
4. If fails → Test on mobile hotspot
5. If mobile works → Network blocking (need VPN)

The miner itself is FINE. It's just a network connectivity issue!
