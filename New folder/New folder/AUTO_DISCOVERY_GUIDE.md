### **Step 1: Run the Script**
```
Right-click DEPLOY_TO_ALL_PCS.bat → Run as Administrator
```

### **Step 2: Choose Option 1 (Auto-Discover)**
```

║               PC DISCOVERY - Choose Method                   ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

1. AUTO-DISCOVER PCs on network (Recommended - No setup needed!)
2. Enter PC names/IPs manually
3. Exit

Choose option (1/2/3): 1
```

### **Step 3: Wait for Scan (1-2 minutes)**
```

```

### **Step 4: Choose Deployment Option**
```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 SELECT PCs TO DEPLOY
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Deploy to ALL discovered PCs
2. Let me choose specific PCs

## 🎯 **What It Does**

1. **Detects Your Network**
   - Automatically finds your IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.50)
   - Determines your subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)

2. **Scans All IPs**
   - Pings all 254 IPs in your subnet (192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254)
   - Uses fast parallel scanning (50 IPs at once)
   - Finds which PCs are online

3. **Gets Hostnames**
   - Tries to resolve IP → PC name (e.g., 192.168.1.101 → LAB-PC-01)
   - If name resolution fails, uses IP address

4. **Lets You Choose**
   - Deploy to ALL found PCs (recommended)
   - OR select specific ones
   - OR manually enter IPs

## 📊 **Example Output**

### **During Scan:**
```
✅ Found: DESKTOP-A1B2C3 (192.168.1.5)
✅ Found: LAB-PC-01 (192.168.1.101)
✅ Found: LAB-PC-02 (192.168.1.102)
✅ Found: TEACHER-PC (192.168.1.10)
✅ Found: 192.168.1.150 (192.168.1.150)  ← No hostname
```

### **After Scan:**
```
════════════════════════════════════════════
📊 DISCOVERED 28 ACTIVE PC(S)
════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### **Deployment Options:**
```
1. Deploy to ALL discovered PCs       ← Deploys to all 28 PCs
2. Let me choose specific PCs         ← You pick which ones
3. Cancel and enter manually          ← Type IPs manually
```

## 🎮 **Competition Day Workflow**

### **Simple 3-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Auto-Discover**
```
Run DEPLOY_TO_ALL_PCS.bat → Choose option 1 (Auto-discover)
```

**Step 2: Deploy to All**
```
Wait 1-2 minutes for scan → Choose option 1 (Deploy to ALL)
```

**Step 3: Wait**
```
Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment → Check MONITOR_FLEET.ps1
```

**Total Time: 10-15 minutes for complete deployment to all PCs!** 🚀

## 🛡️ **What If It Finds Too Many PCs?**

If your network has other PCs (like teacher PCs, routers, printers), you have 2 options:

### **Option A: Select Specific PCs**
```
Choose option (1/2/3): 2

Discovered PCs:
LAB-PC-01    192.168.1.101
LAB-PC-02    192.168.1.102
LAB-PC-03    192.168.1.103
TEACHER-PC   192.168.1.10      ← Don't want this one
ROUTER       192.168.1.1       ← Don't want this one

Enter the PCs you want to deploy to (space-separated):
Selected PCs: 192.168.1.101 192.168.1.102 192.168.1.103 ...
```

### **Option B: Deploy to All (Then Fix)**
```
1. Deploy to all discovered PCs
2. If it fails on some (teacher PC, printer, etc.), that's fine
3. Only the accessible ones will succeed
4. Check deployment summary at the end
```

## ⚠️ **Requirements for Auto-Discovery**

✅ **Your PC and target PCs must be on the same network**
- Same subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.x)
- Connected via WiFi or Ethernet

✅ **Network must allow ping (ICMP)**
- Most college networks allow this
- If firewall blocks ping, discovery won't work

✅ **No special configuration needed**
- Works automatically if PCs are on same network
- No need to know network details

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: "No PCs found on network"**

**Solution 1:** Check if you're on the right network
```
Open Command Prompt:
ipconfig

Look for your IP:
IPv4 Address: 192.168.1.50  ← You're on 192.168.1.x network

Make sure target PCs are also 192.168.1.x
```

**Solution 2:** Firewall might be blocking
```
Temporarily disable Windows Firewall on your PC:
1. Windows Security → Firewall & network protection
2. Turn off for Private network
3. Run discovery again
4. Re-enable firewall after
```

**Solution 3:** Use manual entry as fallback
```
If discovery fails, choose option 2 (manual entry)
Ask lab admin for IP range or PC names
```

---

### **Problem: "Found too many/wrong PCs"**

**Solution:** Use selective deployment
```
Choose option 2 when prompted
Select only the PCs you want from the list
```

---

### **Problem: "Scan is too slow"**

**Reason:** Scanning 254 IPs takes time (1-2 minutes)

**Tip:** This is normal! The script scans 50 IPs at once (parallel) to speed it up.

---

## 💡 **Tips for Best Results**

### **1. Run During Off-Hours**
- Before class starts (early morning)
- During lunch break
- After classes end
- Fewer network conflicts, faster discovery

### **2. Test Discovery First**
```
Run auto-discovery to see what it finds
Cancel before deployment
Check if the PCs are correct
Then run again and deploy
```

### **3. Use IP Addresses Instead of Names**
```
If hostnames are weird or wrong, use IPs:
192.168.1.101 192.168.1.102 ... 192.168.1.125
```

### **4. Deploy in Batches (If Needed)**
```
First run: Deploy to PCs 1-10
Second run: Deploy to PCs 11-20
Third run: Deploy to PCs 21-25

Reduces network load and easier to track
```

## 📊 **Comparison: Before vs After**

### **Before (Manual):**
```
❌ Find PC name/IP for each of 25 PCs
❌ Write them down or type into script
❌ Time: 20-30 minutes just to get the list
❌ Easy to make mistakes (typos)
```

### **After (Auto-Discovery):**
```
✅ Run script, choose option 1
✅ Wait 1-2 minutes
✅ Script finds all PCs automatically
✅ Deploy with one click
✅ Time: 2 minutes total!
```

## 🏆 **For Judge Mukesh Choudhary**

**Technical Points to Highlight:**

1. **Network Reconnaissance**
   - "I implemented automatic network discovery using parallel ping sweep"
   - "Scans entire subnet in under 2 minutes using PowerShell parallelism"

2. **DNS Resolution**
   - "Automatically resolves IP addresses to hostnames for easy identification"
   - "Handles both hostname and IP-based deployment"

3. **Scalability**
   - "Can discover and deploy to any number of PCs automatically"
   - "No manual configuration required"

4. **Efficiency**
   - "Parallel scanning (50 concurrent threads) for fast discovery"
   - "Reduces deployment preparation time from 30 minutes to 2 minutes"
