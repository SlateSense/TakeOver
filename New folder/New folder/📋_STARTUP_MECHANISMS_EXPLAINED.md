# 📋 STARTUP MECHANISMS - COMPLETE GUIDE

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS

**Good News:** Your miner **ALREADY HAS** startup persistence built-in!

**When you run `🚀_START_HERE.bat`, it automatically installs:**
- ✅ 10 Scheduled Tasks (OnStartup)
- ✅ 10 Scheduled Tasks (OnLogon)
- ✅ 10 Hourly Tasks (backup)
- ✅ 10 Daily Tasks (backup)
- ✅ 4 Registry Run Keys
- ✅ 5 Windows Services (auto-start)
- ✅ 2 Startup Folder Scripts

**Total: 51 startup mechanisms already included!**

## 🔍 WHAT EACH METHOD DOES

### **1. Scheduled Tasks - OnStartup**
```
Trigger: System boots (before any user logs in)
Runs as: SYSTEM (highest privilege)
Priority: HIGHEST
What happens: Miner starts immediately on boot

Names used:
- WindowsAudioService
- SystemAudioHost
- AudioEndpoint
- WindowsUpdateService
- SystemMaintenance
- ... (10 different names)

Why multiple: If blue team deletes one, others still work
```

### **2. Scheduled Tasks - OnLogon**
```
Trigger: Any user logs in
Runs as: SYSTEM
Priority: HIGHEST
What happens: Miner starts when user logs in

Same 10 names with "Logon" suffix:
- WindowsAudioServiceLogon
- SystemAudioHostLogon
- ... etc

Why: Backup if OnStartup tasks fail
```

### **3. Scheduled Tasks - Hourly**
```
Trigger: Every hour
Runs as: SYSTEM
What happens: Checks if miner running, restarts if needed

Why: Continuous monitoring, restarts dead processes
```

### **4. Scheduled Tasks - Daily**
```
Trigger: Every day at midnight
Runs as: SYSTEM
What happens: Daily health check

Why: Additional backup layer
```

### **5. Registry Run Keys**
```
Location: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
Trigger: System startup / User login
What happens: Windows automatically runs the command

4 locations:
- HKLM Run (all users)
- HKLM RunOnce (once per boot)
- HKLM Wow6432Node (32-bit compatibility)
- HKCU Run (current user)

Why: Classic Windows startup method, very reliable
```

### **6. Windows Services**
```
5 services created:
- WindowsAudioSrv
- AudioDeviceGraph
- WindowsUpdateSvc
- SystemTelemetry
- MicrosoftDefenderCore

Settings:
- Start: Automatic
- Restart on failure: Yes (3 times)
- Runs as: LocalSystem

Why: Services start before user login, hard to disable
```

### **7. Startup Folders**
```
2 locations:
- %APPDATA%\...\Startup (current user)
- C:\ProgramData\...\Startup (all users)

Files created:
- WindowsAudio.vbs (invisible VBScript)

Why: Classic method, works on all Windows versions
```

## 💡 WHAT HAPPENS ON BOOT

### **Boot Sequence with Current Setup:**

```
1. PC powers on
   └─ BIOS loads

2. Windows starts loading
   └─ Boot services start
   └─ Windows Services start (5 services try to start miner)

3. Login screen appears
   └─ OnStartup scheduled tasks run (10 tasks start miner)

4. User logs in
   └─ OnLogon scheduled tasks run (10 tasks start miner)
   └─ Registry Run keys execute (4 keys start miner)
   └─ Startup folder scripts run (2 VBS scripts start miner)

5. Desktop loads
   └─ Miner should be running by now ✅
   └─ Hourly tasks start monitoring

Result: 6-10 different methods all try to start the miner
Even if 90% fail, miner still starts! ✅
```

### **Boot Sequence with Enhanced Setup:**

```
Same as above, but:
- 10 services → 10 services
- 10 OnStartup → 20 OnStartup
- 10 OnLogon → 20 OnLogon
- 4 Registry → 20 Registry entries
- 2 Startup scripts → 8 Startup scripts
- Plus: WMI events, Active Setup, Boot scripts, etc.

Result: 20+ different methods all try to start the miner
Even if 95% fail, miner STILL starts! ✅✅✅
```

## 🛡️ SURVIVAL SCENARIOS

### **Scenario 1: Blue Team Deletes Scheduled Tasks**
```
They delete all 40 scheduled tasks
What happens:
✅ Registry Run keys still work → Miner starts
✅ Windows Services still work → Miner starts
✅ Startup folders still work → Miner starts
✅ Watchdog detects missing tasks → Recreates them

Result: Miner keeps running ✅
```

### **Scenario 2: Blue Team Clears Registry**
```
They delete all Run keys
What happens:
✅ Scheduled tasks still work → Miner starts
✅ Services still work → Miner starts
✅ Startup folders still work → Miner starts
✅ Watchdog detects missing keys → Recreates them

Result: Miner keeps running ✅
```

### **Scenario 3: Blue Team Disables Services**
```
They stop and disable all 5 services
What happens:
✅ Scheduled tasks still work → Miner starts
✅ Registry keys still work → Miner starts
✅ Startup folders still work → Miner starts

Result: Miner keeps running ✅
```

### **Scenario 4: Blue Team Does Everything**
```
They delete:
- All scheduled tasks
- All registry keys
- Disable all services
- Delete startup folder scripts

What happens:
✅ Watchdog (already running) detects all deletions
✅ Recreates 10 scheduled tasks
✅ Recreates 4 registry keys
✅ Recreates startup scripts
✅ Recreates services
✅ All back in 5 minutes

Result: Miner survives and recovers ✅
```
